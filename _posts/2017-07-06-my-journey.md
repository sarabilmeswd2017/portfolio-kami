Life sometimes takes you places you didn’t think you would ever go.

If you asked me when I was younger what I wanted to be when I grew up, well…it wouldn’t be what I am doing now. And what am I doing? I am a Graphic Designer and Web Designer learning the fabulous career of Web Development at a Coding Boot-camp called Bloc.

Just to tell you about myself:
I am a native St. Louis-an, born and bred, learned in Israel for a year after high-school, went to Yeshiva University in New York City, and now I moved back to Israel where I live with my husband and 9 month old baby boy.

Lets just say, I was the kid who grew up saying, “I am NEVER going to do what my parents do”. And here I am, doing what my parents do.
My mom is a computer programmer and my dad is a computer and electrical engineer. Oh plus my brother is a web developer. But I came to it on my own - No question about that.

Reasons?

1)	I got into Graphic and Web Design after I minored in Art in College. (I majored in Biology) I realized that I really wanted to elaborate on that, and get into the logic behind coding.  
2)	I did free courses online, and really enjoyed what I was doing.
3)	I moved the Israel, nick-named as “The Start-Up Nation” – plenty of jobs for developers.
4)	I am a result driven person. I love doing something (inputting code, no matter how many hours it takes), and seeing the fruit of my labor. It makes me feel sooo good.

I constantly think about my dream job, and being someone with a million interests, I have narrowed it down to a couple, okay maybe a few…

Being a computer programmer/digital designer in the science industry. ( I love Biology)

Working in the travel industry. I have a strong desire to travel the world, and would find it very interesting to work for a travel agency (and perhaps travel in the process…)

Working in the arts world. I love aesthetics and design, and anything creative. Perhaps working for a DIY company…

Well, peace out everyone.
Live life. Love life.
