title: Just Keep Swimming

When I was in high school, I went to a convention for my youth group where I heard a speech from a man named Saul Blinkoff. To this day it is the most inspirational speech I ever heard, and I try to live every day by Saul’s message.

Saul had an entire room of teenagers captivated for an hour and a half, which says a lot by itself.  Saul explained his journey of becoming an animator at Disney. When he was a little boy, he had a dream. He had a dream, and he stuck with his dream. He sweated, fell, almost gave up, got back on his feet, and in the end, he did it. In this process Saul, who is Jewish, ended up becoming religious as well, a difficult lifestyle to sync with the movie industry. But Saul worked around all his challenges, and today he is a religious Jew still working for Disney. He gives inspirational speeches all over the world.

Saul said something that stuck. He said, “No one ever says, ‘I want to be a mediocre lawyer’. Everyone should want to be the best in what they do”.

I don’t want to be a mediocre web developer. I want to be incredible.

To be incredible takes a lot of work.
Thankfully, I have a very helpful and smart father. On Sundays we Skype for a couple of hours. He helps me de-bug issues, we go through codes, and review difficult concepts. I put my all into my work because I believe in myself and believe  I can achieve ‘incredible’.

There are a lot of things I am learning from my dad.

1)	If you have too many if and else statements you probably are making it too complicated. Start over and think about it more simply.
This happened in this case:

I was working on this code for hours and hours, and it was getting really complex. I started it over with my dad, thinking through everything simply, and I was able to walk through the code and complete it in 10 minutes.

2)	Make extremely clear variables, as many as you need. This helps organize things very well.

Like this example:
