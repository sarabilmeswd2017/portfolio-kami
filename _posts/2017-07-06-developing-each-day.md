title: Developing Each Day
---

I have a 9-month-old baby. I see his development change every week! It is truly amazing. Last week he did not crawl, this week he crawls. Last week he was afraid of eating food that was too solid, now he has moved from eating mush to eating bread. (Well I am not sure how much he actually is eating...but still).

I feel that every day, I am developing as a developer. A couple weeks ago it took me hours to do a code on Codewars. This week, I did a code in my mentor’s assessment review in about 10 minutes. It’s amazing!

If we keep doing what we are doing, and don’t give up, we will keep on developing our skills each day.

Keep Chillin
