## Explanation

Bloc-Jams is a music playing site, with complete integration of DOM scripting. This is my first site I have made with this level of complexity. It was a challenging project, but well worth it in the end. Many aspects of the site needed to be debugged and modified for perfect performance. I first completed the site in Javascript, then refactored to Jquery, and then switched it completley over to AngularJS. I learned a ton along the way, and cant wait to keep building and keep growing. Jam away!

## Problem

Problems to tackle in building Bloc-Jams:
When a song is played, that is the only song that can play.
When a song is paused/played the different icons change to pause or play buttons.
Integrating the player bar to play/pause and to use the next and previous buttons.
Muting the songs.
Have the player bar update the time as the song plays.
Being able to move the player bar to a different part of the song.
Being able to change the volume of the song.


## Solution

A lot of code...hmm how do I write this...

## Results

I did not yet test this.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot about the logic of coding and figured out logically how to get from point A to point B.
