## Explanation

Bloc Chat is a chat room application. You can select a room, add a message, create a username. This application was created with Firebase and AngularJS.

## Problem

There are many aspects to building this project. The room lists need to appear on the side, and you need to be able to add a room. When you click on the room, the messages from the room needs to appear, connected with the user who typed the message and the time it was sent. You need to be able to enter a username and it be saved via the $cookie method. Last but not least you need to be able to add a message to the room you are in, and have it update in the view.

## Solution

This project combined Angular and Firebase to create the database system we need to create this application. I created Controlles to connect to services, and called those functions in the view.

## Results

A fully working Chat Room Application.

## Conclusion

Angular takes a lot of time and effort to understand, but once you understand the basic setup, you can use that method to create the whole application.
